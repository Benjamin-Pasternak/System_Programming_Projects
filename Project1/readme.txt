-> The files were tested by manually checking the output given by the program and the expected output.

-> The files were also tested by the diff command on linux.

-> Different types of files and scenarios were tested to make sure that the program is working correctly

-> Some of the types of files that were tested are as follows:

	-A file with no input
	-A file with only one letter on one line
	-A file with with more than one consecutive whit-space including new lines
	-A file ending without a new line
	-A file ending with a new line

	-A file with only one word
	-A file with a very long word that is bigger than the buffer size
	-Files from Mac OS
	-Files from Windows OS

-> The program was tested with different buffer sizes and all the files noted above.
   It gave the correct output for each scenario.
